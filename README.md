Options Pricing Engine is a Monte Carlo–based European option pricer implemented in both C (with pthreads) and Python (with multiprocessing). It simulates millions of asset price paths using the Box–Muller Gaussian generator, distributes the work across all CPU cores, and then aggregates payoffs to compute call and put prices for a European vanilla option. The project is designed to compare performance and scalability between the C and Python implementations while producing numerically consistent option prices.
